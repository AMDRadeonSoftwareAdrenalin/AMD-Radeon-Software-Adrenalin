**AMD Radeon Software Adrenalin** is the next generation of software and drivers for **AMD Radeon GPUs** to deliver the best performance in gaming, video streaming, and VR

- **Radeon Boost** — Delivers an average performance boost of up to 23 percent during fast-paced gaming scenes by dynamically downscaling, for faster frame rates and smoother, more responsive performance without noticeably degrading image quality. Radeon Boost is already supported in several popular gaming projects. Support for other games will be gradually added.
- **AMD Link** — The application has received an updated interface that matches the design of the desktop application. AMD Link now allows users to stream mobile gameplay to smartphones and tablets.
- **Integer Display Scaling** — Allows you to scale the display from one pixel to four or more. The result is a pixelated look for classic retro games with ultra-sharp scaling optimized for high-PPI displays without sacrificing performance.
- **DirectML Media Filters** — Machine learning-based filters to reduce visual noise and distortion when scaling, improve the display of photo and video content and perform better than traditional filters.
- **Image Sharpening and Radeon Anti-lag** — Radeon Image Sharpening now supports not only DX9, DX12 and Vulkan games, but also DirectX 11 games. The function allows users to adjust the degree of sharpness of the picture. Radeon Anti-lag has received DirectX 9 gaming support for GPU families up to RX5000.

Everything is done very simply by dragging the frequency and speed sliders. Be sure to monitor the temperatures of the graphics card in case of overclocking.

# Optimization for mining Compute Mode

GPUs are increasingly being used for tasks other than rendering and image processing. GPU acceleration is getting a lot of applications that take advantage of their rich computing power, and one of the main topics of recent times has been cryptocurrency mining. AMD already released in October a special version of drivers 17.10.2, specially optimized for this purpose, and the increase in speed when mining with it was quite noticeable.

But the need to install either «gaming» or «mining» drivers is not always convenient, and AMD logically decided to make a universal version. Starting from Adrenalin 17.12.1, optimizations can be switched from graphical tasks to computing tasks at any time. Users can now fully utilize the computing power of their GPUs for a variety of tasks, maximizing performance in all conditions and without the need to reinstall drivers.

To change the type of optimization, you need to go to the Gaming tab of the Radeon Settings drivers, select Global Settings and find the «GPU Workload» switch there, which allows you to select Graphics or Compute. This setting is designed for mining Ethereum cryptocurrency, for example, and it allowed us to get an increase in speed when mining it by almost 14% — from 21.7 to 24.8 MH / s when using a Radeon RX 570 4 GB video card with Claymore’s Dual software Ethereum. By the way, according to AMD specialists, who have access to their own statistics, only about 2% of all users use their video cards for mining tasks. But since they have optimized the drivers for such tasks, then maybe there are actually a few more of them?
